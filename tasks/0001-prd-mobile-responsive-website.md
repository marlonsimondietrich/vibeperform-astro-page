# Mobile Responsiveness Optimization PRD

## 1. Introduction / Overview
The current VibePerform marketing site provides a comprehensive narrative for AI consulting services but exhibits inconsistent behavior on smaller screens. Navigation overflow, non-adaptive layouts, and oversized media assets reduce usability, increase bounce rates, and undermine conversions from mobile visitors. This initiative delivers a responsive, mobile-first experience across every homepage section and reusable component in the Astro codebase so prospective clients and leads can explore offerings seamlessly on phones and tablets.

## 2. Goals
- Ensure all homepage sections (Navigation through Contact) render without horizontal scrolling on viewports ≥320px wide.
- Achieve readable typography, tappable controls (≥44px touch targets), and accessible contrast on mobile and tablet breakpoints.
- Maintain or improve current Lighthouse performance, accessibility, and SEO scores (no decrease >2 points) after responsive updates.
- Reduce mobile bounce rate by 10% within one month of launch (baseline from analytics).

## 3. User Stories
- As a site visitor on a smartphone, I can read copy, interact with CTAs, and navigate the full homepage without pinching or zooming.
- As a prospect reviewing offerings on a tablet, I can scan section cards and switch tabs without layout jumps or content truncation.
- As a marketing manager, I can publish new content blocks using existing components with confidence that they remain responsive across breakpoints.
- As an accessibility reviewer, I can validate that keyboard focus, touch targets, and color contrast meet WCAG AA on mobile.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. Provide responsive breakpoints for key ranges (≤640px, 641–1024px, ≥1025px) with fluid layouts and content scaling between them.
2. Implement a collapsible navigation pattern for ≤768px widths (e.g., hamburger menu) that supports focus trapping, keyboard navigation, and language toggle.
3. Reflow the hero section to stack headline, subhead, CTAs, and social proof with optimized typography and compressed media for mobile.
4. Ensure each homepage section (Problem→Lösung, Leistungen cards, Ablauf timeline, Business-Mehrwert metrics, Fokusthemen tabs, Artefakte gallery, Preise table, Compliance FAQ, Ressourcen downloads, Kundenstimmen, Über uns) uses a responsive grid/stack pattern that prevents text overlap and maintains spacing.
5. Optimize cards, timelines, and tab components to use CSS grid/flexbox with wrap behavior; cards should reduce columns progressively (desktop 3, tablet 2, mobile 1).
6. Configure CTAs, buttons, and tab triggers to maintain minimum hit area (44×44px) and vertical spacing for touch usability.
7. Ensure images, SVGs, and media elements are responsive (`max-width: 100%`, intrinsic sizing, `picture`/`srcset` where useful) and lazy-loaded when off-screen.
8. Audit typography scales for mobile (hierarchy, line lengths ≤70 characters, line height ≥1.4) and adjust spacing tokens to avoid cramped layouts.
9. Validate that forms (newsletter, contact) and input controls align vertically on mobile, display contextual error messages, and preserve keyboard-friendly labeling.
10. Update shared layout and section components so future additions inherit responsive behavior with minimal overrides (documentation or Storybook notes if available).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Redesigning visual branding, copywriting, or core information architecture.
- Building new sections or altering the existing navigation hierarchy beyond responsive behavior.
- Implementing analytics dashboards or third-party A/B testing frameworks.
- Replacing the underlying Astro framework or introducing a component library migration.

## 6. Design Considerations
- Follow existing typography, color, and spacing tokens documented in `docs/website-structure.md`; extend token set only if necessary for responsive sizes.
- Maintain visual hierarchy consistency between breakpoints; hero CTA should remain primary and visually prominent.
- Provide design references or responsive mocks (Figma/Sketch) for navigation, cards, tabs, and timeline components to reduce ambiguity.
- Consider mobile-first animation adjustments (reduced motion, shorter durations) to keep interactions smooth on low-end devices.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Leverage Astro’s component architecture and scoped styles; prefer CSS modules or Tailwind classes already in use within the project.
- Use custom properties or utility classes for breakpoints to keep styles maintainable; document any new breakpoint tokens.
- Ensure responsive changes pass existing unit/e2e tests; add new visual regression snapshots if the team uses Playwright or similar tooling.
- Validate with real devices/emulators (Chrome DevTools, Safari responsive mode) and target iOS ≥15, Android ≥11, desktop Chrome/Safari/Firefox.
- Monitor bundle size impact; avoid inline duplication of large media assets and ensure `vite` build output stays within performance budgets.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Lighthouse Accessibility and Best Practices ≥90 on mobile after release.
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≤0.1 and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) ≤2.5s on 4G simulated mobile.
- Mobile bounce rate decreases by 10% and average time-on-page increases by 8% one month post-launch.
- Support tickets or internal reports about mobile layout issues drop to zero in the first two weeks after deployment.

## 9. Open Questions
- Do we have existing analytics benchmarks for mobile traffic (bounce, conversion) to validate success metrics?
- Are there prioritized devices/browsers from current user data that require explicit QA (e.g., iPhone SE, Galaxy S10)?
- Should responsive updates extend to subpages (Use-Cases, Ressourcen, etc.) in this release or only the homepage?
- Is there a preferred iconography or animation guideline for condensed mobile views (e.g., replacing text labels with icons in nav)?
- Will marketing provide updated assets (optimized images, shorter copy variants) to support responsive layouts?
