# Responsive Navbar Experience PRD

## 1. Introduction / Overview
The current mobile navigation menu fails to open reliably, surfaces console errors (`Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement`), and the navbar experience lacks consistency across pages. This project will deliver a resilient, accessible hamburger menu and a uniform navbar component integration so that every page presents the same visual appearance and interaction, without layout shifts when navigating.

## 2. Goals
- Ensure the hamburger menu opens and closes consistently on mobile devices.
- Maintain identical navbar structure, spacing, and behavior on every page consuming the shared component.
- Provide a smooth slide-down animation for menu reveal while preventing page content jumpiness.
- Eliminate inline-script syntax errors by replacing ad-hoc DOM wiring with a vetted responsive navbar pattern.

## 3. User Stories
- As a mobile visitor, I want to tap the hamburger icon to reveal navigation links so I can reach any section quickly.
- As a visitor switching between pages, I expect the navbar to remain visually stable so the experience feels cohesive.
- As a content editor, I want to update navigation links in one place so changes propagate everywhere.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The navbar must expose a hamburger toggle for viewports `< md` (Tailwind’s breakpoint) and render inline links for `md` and above.
2. Tapping the hamburger must toggle aria state, lock background scrolling, and slide the menu container down when opened and up when closed.
3. Adopt an accessible “disclosure” pattern from a maintained Tailwind or Astro component source (e.g., Tailwind UI, Flowbite, AstroWind) so keyboard trapping, aria attributes, and focus management follow audited guidance.
4. The mobile menu must include all navigation links and the locale toggle, each remaining focusable and clickable.
5. The navbar component must be reused without per-page overrides; any page importing it must receive identical markup ordering and spacing.
6. The component must prevent layout shifts when navigating between pages (e.g., preserve container height, avoid dynamic padding changes).
7. The implementation must run without console errors in modern evergreen browsers and avoids top-level `return` statements in inline scripts.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Adding, removing, or reordering navigation destinations.
- Redesigning navbar typography, colors, or spacing beyond what is necessary to meet the requirements.
- Introducing additional analytics or tracking events.

## 6. Design Considerations
- Preserve existing Tailwind utility classes and general aesthetic already used on the site.
- Slide-down animation should feel responsive (<250 ms) and not rely on external libraries.
- Select a reference implementation from Tailwind UI, Flowbite, or an official Astro starter as the baseline, then tune token usage (spacing, typography) to match current branding.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Centralize show/hide state handling inside `src/components/NavBar.astro`; avoid duplicating logic downstream.
- Ensure generated IDs remain stable per render cycle to support hydration; guard against server/client mismatches.
- Evaluate whether the menu should be rendered via Astro transitions or simple CSS/JS combination.
- Replace `document.currentScript` reliance with deterministic selectors (`id`, `data-*`) so the component works after HTML transforms.
- Leverage the event lifecycle documented by Astro (`astro:before-swap`, etc.) to clean up listeners when using partial page transitions.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Manual QA checklist: run `npm run dev`, open the site in a mobile viewport, verify menu opens/closes with animation, links are clickable, scroll is locked while open, and layout remains stable when switching pages.
- Console remains free of JavaScript errors or warnings related to the navbar during the QA checklist.

## 9. Open Questions
- Should we add integration tests (Playwright, etc.) later to prevent regressions?
- Is there a preferred component library (Tailwind UI vs. Flowbite vs. AstroWind) we should standardize on for future navigation patterns?
